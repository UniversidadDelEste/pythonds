"A **deque**, also known as a double-ended queue, is an ordered collection"
" of items similar to the queue. It has two ends, a front and a rear, and "
"the items remain positioned in the collection. What makes a deque "
"different is the unrestrictive nature of adding and removing items. New "
"items can be added at either the front or the rear. Likewise, existing "
"items can be removed from either end. In a sense, this hybrid linear "
"structure provides all the capabilities of stacks and queues in a single "
"data structure. :ref:`Figure 1 <fig_basicdeque>` shows a deque of Python "
"data objects."

"It is important to note that even though the deque can assume many of the"
" characteristics of stacks and queues, it does not require the LIFO and "
"FIFO orderings that are enforced by those data structures. It is up to "
"you to make consistent use of the addition and removal operations."
