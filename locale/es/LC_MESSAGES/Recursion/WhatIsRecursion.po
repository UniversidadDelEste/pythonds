"**Recursion** is a method of solving problems that involves breaking a "
"problem down into smaller and smaller subproblems until you get to a "
"small enough problem that it can be solved trivially. Usually recursion "
"involves a function calling itself. While it may not seem like much on "
"the surface, recursion allows us to write elegant solutions to problems "
"that may otherwise be very difficult to program."
