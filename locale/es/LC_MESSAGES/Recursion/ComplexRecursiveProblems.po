"In the previous sections we looked at some problems that are relatively "
"easy to solve and some graphically interesting problems that can help us "
"gain a mental model of what is happening in a recursive algorithm. In "
"this section we will look at some problems that are really difficult to "
"solve using an iterative programming style but are very elegant and easy "
"to solve using recursion. We will finish up by looking at a deceptive "
"problem that at first looks like it has an elegant recursive solution but"
" in fact does not."
