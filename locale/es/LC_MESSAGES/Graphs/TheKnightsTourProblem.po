"Another classic problem that we can use to illustrate a second common "
"graph algorithm is called the “knight’s tour.” The knight’s tour puzzle "
"is played on a chess board with a single chess piece, the knight. The "
"object of the puzzle is to find a sequence of moves that allow the knight"
" to visit every square on the board exactly once. One such sequence is "
"called a “tour.” The knight’s tour puzzle has fascinated chess players, "
"mathematicians and computer scientists alike for many years. The upper "
"bound on the number of possible legal tours for an eight-by-eight "
"chessboard is known to be :math:`1.305 \\times 10^{35}`; however, there "
"are even more possible dead ends. Clearly this is a problem that requires"
" some real brains, some real computing power, or both."

"Although researchers have studied many different algorithms to solve the "
"knight’s tour problem, a graph search is one of the easiest to understand"
" and program. Once again we will solve the problem using two main steps:"
