For example, by knowing that a list was ordered, we could search in logarithmic time using a binary search. In this section we will attempt to go one step further by building a data structure that can be searched in :math:`O(1)` time. This concept is referred to as **hashing**."

msgid "A **hash table** is a collection of items which are stored in such a way as to make it easy to find them later. Each position of the hash table, often called a **slot**, can hold an item and is named by an integer value starting at 0. For example, we will have a slot named 0, a slot named 1, a slot named 2, and so on. Initially, the hash table contains no items so every slot is empty. We can implement a hash table by using a list with each element initialized to the special Python value ``None``. :ref:`Figure 4 <fig_hashtable1>` shows a hash table of size :math:`m=11`. In other words, there are *m* slots in the table, named 0 through 10."

The hash function will take any item in the collection and return an integer in the range of slot names, between 0 and *m*-1. Assume that we have the set of integer items 54, 26, 93, 17, 77, and 31. Our first hash function, sometimes referred to as the “remainder method,” simply takes an item and divides it by the table size, returning the remainder as its hash value (:math:`h(item)=item \\% 11`). :ref:`Table 4 <tbl_hashvalues1>` gives all of the hash values for our example items. Note that this remainder method (modulo arithmetic) will typically be present in some form in all hash functions, since the result must be in the range of slot names."

According to the hash function, two or more items would need to be in the same slot. This is referred to as a **collision** (it may also be called a “clash”).

If we know the items and the collection will never change, then it is possible to construct a perfect hash function (refer to the exercises for more about perfect hash functions). Unfortunately, given an arbitrary collection of items, there is no systematic way to construct a perfect hash function. Luckily, we do not need the hash function to be perfect to still gain performance efficiency."
msgstr ""

msgid "One way to always have a perfect hash function is to increase the size of the hash table so that each possible value in the item range can be accommodated. This guarantees that each item will have a unique slot. Although this is practical for small numbers of items, it is not feasible when the number of possible items is large. For example, if the items were nine-digit Social Security numbers, this method would require almost one billion slots. If we only want to store data for a class of 25 students, we will be wasting an enormous amount of memory."

msgid "The **folding method** for constructing hash functions begins by dividing the item into equal-size pieces (the last piece may not be of equal size). These pieces are then added together to give the resulting hash value. For example, if our item was the phone number 436-555-4601, we would take the digits and divide them into groups of 2 (43,65,55,46,01). After the addition, :math:`43+65+55+46+01`, we get 210. If we assume our hash table has 11 slots, then we need to perform the extra step of dividing by 11 and keeping the remainder. In this case :math:`210\\ \\%\\ 11` is 1, so the phone number 436-555-4601 hashes to slot 1. Some folding methods go one step further and reverse every other piece before the addition. For the above example, we get :math:`43+56+55+64+01 = 219` which gives :math:`219\\ \\%\\ 11 = 10`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/SortSearch/Hashing.rst:141
msgid "Another numerical technique for constructing a hash function is called the **mid-square method**. We first square the item, and then extract some portion of the resulting digits. For example, if the item were 44, we would first compute :math:`44 ^{2} = 1,936`. By extracting the middle two digits, 93, and performing the remainder step, we get 5 (:math:`93\\ \\%\\ 11`). :ref:`Table 5 <tbl_hashvalues2>` shows items under both the remainder method and the mid-square method. You should verify that you understand how these values were computed."

However, since this is often not possible, collision resolution becomes a very important part of hashing."

A simple way to do this is to start at the original hash value position and then move in a sequential manner through the slots until we encounter the first slot that is empty. Note that we may need to go back to the first slot (circularly) to cover the entire hash table. This collision resolution process is referred to as **open addressing** in that it tries to find the next open slot or address in the hash table. By systematically visiting each slot one at a time, we are performing an open addressing technique called **linear probing**."

When we compute the hash value, we get 5. Looking in slot 5 reveals 93, and we can return ``True``. What if we are looking for 20? Now the hash value is 9, and slot 9 is currently holding 31. We cannot simply return ``False`` since we know that there could have been collisions.

msgid "A disadvantage to linear probing is the tendency for **clustering**; items become clustered in the table. This means that if many collisions occur at the same hash value, a number of surrounding slots will be filled by the linear probing resolution. This will have an impact on other items that are being inserted, as we saw when we tried to add the item 20 above. A cluster of values hashing to 0 had to be skipped to finally find an open position.

With simple linear probing, the rehash function is :math:`newhashvalue = rehash(oldhashvalue)` where :math:`rehash(pos) = (pos + 1) \\% sizeoftable`. The “plus 3” rehash can be defined as :math:`rehash(pos) = (pos+3) \\% sizeoftable`. In general, :math:`rehash(pos) = (pos + skip) \\% sizeoftable`. It is important to note that the size of the “skip” must be such that all the slots in the table will eventually be visited. Otherwise, part of the table will be unused. To ensure this, it is often suggested that the table size be a prime number. This is the reason we have been using 11 in our examples."

msgid "A variation of the linear probing idea is called **quadratic probing**. Instead of using a constant “skip” value, we use a rehash function that increments the hash value by 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on. This means that if the first hash value is *h*, the successive values are :math:`h+1`, :math:`h+4`, :math:`h+9`, :math:`h+16`, and so on.

msgid "``hashfunction`` implements the simple remainder method. The collision resolution technique is linear probing with a “plus 1” rehash function. The ``put`` function (see :ref:`Listing 3 <lst_hashtablecodestore>`) assumes that there will eventually be an empty slot unless the key is already present in the ``self.slots``. It computes the original hash value and if that slot is not empty, iterates the ``rehash`` function until an empty slot occurs. If a nonempty slot already contains the key, the old data value is replaced with the new data value.  Dealing with the situation where there are no empty slots left is an exercise."

If :math:`\\lambda` is large, meaning that the table is filling up, then there are more and more collisions. This means that collision resolution is more difficult, requiring more comparisons to find an empty slot. With chaining, increased collisions means an increased number of items on each chain."
